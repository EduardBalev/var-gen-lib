# var-gen

## Variable generator for CSS

This library is designed to ease the lot of interface designers. You can generate a style file with CSS Custom Properties or SASS variables (in the future) for your design system.

### My TODOs:

- Write more tests
- Refactor css-convertor
- ... more convert types (like .scss .sass atc)
